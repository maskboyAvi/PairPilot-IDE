# Learning Notes

This folder is my running set of notes while building PairPilot IDE.

I keep these notes short and practical:

- what I was trying to build
- what I implemented in the code
- what broke / what surprised me
- what I’d change next

If you want the step-by-step implementation journal, start here:

- [Learning/BuildLogic/README.md](BuildLogic/README.md)
